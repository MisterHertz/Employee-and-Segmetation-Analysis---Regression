# ðŸ“Š Employee Income & Segmentation Analysis
**MAJU JAYA DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY â€“ Data Science Portfolio Project**

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project explores factors affecting employee income, builds predictive models to estimate **monthly income**, and provides insights for HR decision-making. The dataset contains employee demographic, work-related, and performance attributes.  

Main goals:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distribution and relationships.  
- Build a **regression model** to predict employee `monthly_income`.  
- Provide insights into which features are most influential for income prediction.  
- (Optional) Perform clustering for employee segmentation.

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology

### 1. Business Understanding
- **Background:** The company wants to understand factors that influence employee income and leverage insights for recruitment, compensation, and retention strategies.  
- **Objective:** Predict monthly income using regression models and provide insights into key influencing factors.  
- **Modeling Selection:** Regression task with algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **XGBoost**.  

### 2. Data Preparation
- Handle missing values with **mean/median imputation** for numerical features and **mode imputation** for categorical features.  
- Encode categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.  
- Scale numerical features (optional, depending on model).  

### 3. Modeling
- Train regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- Evaluate using **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²**.  

### 4. Insights
- **Years of Experience** has the strongest positive correlation with income.  
- **Bonus Percentage** and **Overtime Hours** show negligible correlation.  
- **Weekly hours** have only a weak positive correlation.
